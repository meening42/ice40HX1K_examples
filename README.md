# ICE40 HX1K Example Projects
This repository is "spinof" of https://github.com/nesl/ice40_examples.git and contains example projects targeting the Lattice iCE40 HX1K FGPA the IceStorm open-source synthesis toolchain.


### blinky
This is a simple project with a 32 bit 12 MHz counter. All 8 LEDs on the development board are used to illustrate binary counting on some of the higher bits in the counter. This is a good starting place to test that your Icestorm toolchain is up and running.
